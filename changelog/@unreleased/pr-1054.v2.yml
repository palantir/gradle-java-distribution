fix:
  description: When parsing the `sls-manifest/diagnostics.json` file out of jars,
    sls-packaging no longer performs strict validation on its structure (as this can
    prevent the rollout of jars which include extra fields). Instead it just passes
    everything on as long as it's a JSON object.
